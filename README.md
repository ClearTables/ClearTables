# ClearTables #

An [osm2pgsql](https://github.com/openstreetmap/osm2pgsql) multi-backend style designed to simplify consumption of OSM data for rendering, export, or analysis.

## Requirements ##

- [osm2pgsql 0.88.0](https://github.com/openstreetmap/osm2pgsql) or later. The multi-backend is used, which 0.86.0 does not support.
- [PostgreSQL 9.1](http://www.postgresql.org/)
- [PostGIS](http://postgis.net/) 2.0
- Python with [PyYAML](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML)

## Principles ##

These are still a bit vague, and might be split into principles and practices

* Simplify data for the consumer

* Use PostgreSQL types other than `text` if appropriate

* Use boolean for yes/no values

* Use enum types where there's a defined list of possibilities

## Usage ##

    make
    osm2pgsql -d database --output multi --style cleartables.json extract.osm.pbf
